- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

-1
- setTimeout is pushed to timers phase.
- The someAsynOperation Queues a I/O operation in poll , and its corresponding callback is pushed to pending callbacks. 
- After main thread completes and I/O is completed even though timer may be up for the settimeout first the pending call back for I/O is executed 
- After tbis given poll is still idle the timer callback (which is now moved to pending callbacks after 100ms are up) is finally executed. 

-2 
- order of execution will still not change as callback for I/O will compolete first before it moves on to the timer phase callbacks . 

-3 
- If its changed to 0 , most of the time setTimeout callback will be executed first, because this call back is pushed to pending callback first 
  before file I/Os callback is pushed to the queue. As file I/Os callback wont be pushed to the pending callback queue until I/O itself is completed.
